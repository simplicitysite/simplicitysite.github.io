	<p><b>Vulcan</b> is the framework we use to perform deployments, migrations and backups in virtualised/ cloud environments.</p>
	<p>
        It allows a developer to write a <b>specification</b> of the deployment, along with <b>assertions</b> that the task has been run correctly.
        Together, this allows deploy specifications to be developed in a test driven way, allowing the ideal of <b>Infrastructure as Code</b> to be fully realised.
	</p>
    <p>The Vulcan source code is currently being migrated, please check back soon for access.</p>
