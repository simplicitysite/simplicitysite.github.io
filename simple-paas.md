Creating a Platform for Innovation
----

Businesses and business models are undergoing unprecedented stresses and changes as the
full force of the digital revolution is being felt. Nimble competitors are innovating fast; the risk
of falling behind is present.

Innovation can be encouraged within a company to ensure that the company thrives on
competition, and gains strength from external stresses.

A technology platform that supports and encourages this innovation can be built on the
promises of Cloud architectures and fully deliver on them, by tying the platform explicitly to
delivering business value instead of solely technical merit.

This paper introduces the disruptive effects of the Digital Revolution, how companies can
meet that disruption by generating internal competition and so thrive through Innovation and
finally how to technically support that vision via Innovation as a Platform.
