Are you happy with the 3 tier architecture in your Grails applications? 
In this talk David will show how to apply the Life Preserver tool to implement the Hexagonal architecture in Grails applications. With plenty of code and a sample application, there will be discussion on using plugins, messaging and the features of Groovy itself to create the required structures and decoupling.‚Äù
