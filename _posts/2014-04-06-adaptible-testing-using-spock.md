By now, we all know the mantra of automated testing helping our production code stay production ready and be open to change. What happens when your tests themselves become part of the problem? When your tests slow down development and prevent you from delivering as fast as you think you could do?

Pulling examples out of real life projects that suffer from heavy weight testing stifling development and preventing valuable changes being made; David will give code based solutions using the industry leading tools Spock and JBehave, showing how your tests can be re-structured and designed to consistently aid development and the pace of delivery.
