In this talk, David will showcase some of the many features of Groovy. How the flexibility of the language alongside other JVM languages can be used to give flexibility in your architecture and allow your system to avoid some of the baggage of large scale development.

With plenty of code, strong opinions and examples, weâ€™ll be covering Postels law, internal integration, static/ dynamic and why Groovy is among the best languages for enabling large scale development.
