Drums, lungs, strums and … umm, guns? Perhaps not the last one!

Thinking of popping home early? Don't! Life's boring there! Or if it's not, then that exciting life will still be there in a few hours!

Maybe trying one last time to nullify your existential pain with CnH2n+1OH or topping up on C8H10N4O2? We can do that after, of that I promise you!

Or maybe you're watching the exhibition floors empty, the mediocre coffee being drained slowly into the dustbins beside the politician (or judge, take your pick) too inebriated to walk to Westminster tube from the Westminster Arms, the sad flop of yet another batch of unread promo leaflets from a QCon bag scutter across the street... and desperate for one last foray before the delight that is QCon London 2014 comes to a close?

This talk won't disappoint. Today I'm formally announcing the anti-keynote, the 'footnote', 'bootnote' or 'locknote' perhaps. Typically the last talk of the conference, on the last day, in the biggest room is a poison chalice of cosmological proportions but I see this as an opportunity to buck that trend (or simply have a lot of fun trying).

So you want a PaaS… Really?! No, seriously, why? Ok all the cool kids are interested in them, and peer pressure still has a lot to answer for but… really, why?

In this talk Russ will be his irreverent self and throw everything, including the chef's workplace washing area, into a talk where he'll expound on his experiences using and building PaaSs, and things like PaaSs, for various organisations. He'll take you on a search for truth in PaaS, and it will be quite a journey!

PaaS is not one-size-fits-all, there are many twists-betwixt-cup-and-lip, and this talk will examine the many flavours of technology that can get you where you need to be against the various real benefits that a PaaS might deliver.

You might be forgiven for thinking that this might be more entertainment than information and knowledge, but there you'd be wrong! Russ will be deep-diving through various technologies that can be used to get the right PaaS-related benefits for you, often without the need for a full-blown PaaS at all. If you want to be able to evaluate, use, build and be smart in your technology selection when aiming for real benefits from PaaS then hanging out to the bitter end of the conference for this talk will not be a waste of your time.

So now the talk has been effectively bigged-up enough, I hope to see you there and the new 'locknote' session to be born!
