We've spent over a decade now becoming more and more agile and adaptable in our ways of working. Unfortunately our software is now struggling to keep up with the pace of innovation that is increasingly being demanded by modern businesses.

Russ Miles will explore why the Architectural Monolith's days are numbered. Looking at the greatest failures and small successes of the past, Russ will help us understand the properties we need from our software in order to survive in a post-agile future and where antifragility, reactive and microservices architectures fit in.

In the future your software won't just have to embrace change, it will need to thrive on it. In this talk you'll find out how that is achievable today.
