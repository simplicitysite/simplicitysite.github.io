	<p>We believe there isn't one process to fit every organization. Instead, we take the ideas that work from different processes like iterative development, design patterns, and risk driven scheduling, and help you understand why they work and what they could do for you. Best of all, Head First Software Development puts this information into your brain in a way that sticks. If you've never read a Head First book before, there's nothing like it â€” great visuals, good stories, and hands-on exercises to let you get comfortable with the techniques. There are a lot of boring books on the philosophy of software; this isn't one of them. Expect to get dirty. Expect to be shocked. Expect to learn</p>
