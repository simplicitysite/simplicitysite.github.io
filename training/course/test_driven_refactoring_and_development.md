# Test Driven Refactoring and Development

This course provides a comprehensive, practical and, where possible, context sensitive approach to learning two of the most critical techniques needed by modern software developers, namely Enabling Emergent Design, Test-Driven Development and Refactoring. Together these techniques help teams build applications quicker and more reliably, regardless of language, platform or framework.

This course follows a carefully paced approach to learning the topics, providing opportunities to learn, contemplate, question and apply these techniques.



Logistics
---------

This course can be taken on its own or using attendee's own codebases as the backdrop for the topics learned. The latter option is recommended as it maximises the learning available and delivers context-sensitive knowledge that can be immediately applied when the attendee returns to work.
