# Introduction to Building Microservices 

With *Russ Miles*

This hands-on, extremely practical tutorial will teach you how to design, deploy and manage microservice based architectures.

Microservices are a new approach to architecting applications that embrace and thrive on change. They are simple, single-purpose, lightweight architectural components that enable you to deliver software faster.

The microservice architectural approach also aims to lead to software that thrives on change while at the same time being secure, performant, and stable.

## Audience

If you are interested in gaining the advantages, and managing the challenges, of building software that can embrace change using the microservice architectural and design approach, then this course is for you!

### Bring Your Own Hardware

This course requires you to bring your own laptop with the following installation:
* Create a free GitHub account as this will be the easiest means of grabbing the lab code.
Use the IDE of your choice, as long as it supports Gradle as a build system (Spring Toolsuite or IntelliJ are ideal).
* Either preinstall or an installer will be made available for Oracle VirtualBox in order to run a hosting virtual machine for some of the coding labs.

### In this course you will learn how to

* Architect, Build, Deploy & Manage Microservice-based Software Architectures

## Programme

* Understand Microservices in term of their Principles, Benefits and Challenges
